# Fastify Workshop 101

This repo is a workshop for Fastify.
It is a simple API that has a few endpoints that are used to demonstrate the features of Fastify.

Each branch in this repo represents a step in the workshop.
The `master` branch is the starting point and each subsequent branch builds on the previous one.

Hope you enjoy it!

Good luck!
